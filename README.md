Implementation can be seen at sandhelper.net

Must use your own Google Maps API Key and put it in line 110 of gMaps.html
<script async defer src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&callback=initMap"> </script>
Easy by following the directions on this page: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key
